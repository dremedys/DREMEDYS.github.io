        <p>Bitseven ("BS", "we", "us" and "our") respect and protect the privacy of visitors to our websites and our customers who use our services. To ensure transparency, this Privacy Policy describes our information handling practices when you access content we own or operate on the websites located at totalcoin.io, or any other websites, pages, features, or content we own or operate (collectively, the "Site(s)") and/or when you use the Totalcoin mobile app and related services (referred to collectively hereinafter as "Services"). Please take a moment to read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
        <h3>Acceptance of the privacy policy</h3>
        <p>By accessing and using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read the terms of this Privacy Policy. You consent to the processing of your personal information as described below. BS may provide additional information “just in time” or additional information on the methods of collection, use and exchange of data of specific Services. These notices may supplement or clarify BS privacy rules or may provide you with additional options for how BS processes your data. If you do not agree or are not satisfied with any aspect of this Privacy Policy, you must immediately stop accessing or using our Services.</p>
        <h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time, and if required by law, we will notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make any significant changes, we will notify you by push message (sent to your device) or by notification of our services before the change takes effect.</p>
        <h3>Personal information we collect</h3>
        <p>Personal information can be used to directly or indirectly identify you or contact you. Our Privacy Policy applies to all personal information that you voluntarily provide to us and which we receive from our partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to anonymous data, as it cannot be used for your identification. You may be asked to provide personal information at any time when you contact BS. BS will not transfer, sell, rent or lend any personal information to third parties.</p>
        <h4>Personal information collected</h4>
        <p>We collect personal information to provide you our Services. When we request certain personal information from users, this is because such information is relevant for certain purposes. Any information that you provide to us that is not required is voluntary. In addition, we may collect personal information that you disclose in advertising. Any information that is disclosed this way becomes publicly available and, therefore, may appear publicly, for example, through the search engines or other publicly accessible platforms, and may be “crawled” or searched by third parties. It can also be read, compiled, or used by other users to send you unsolicited messages. Please do not post information that you do not want to disclose to the general public. You can choose whether to provide us with the types of personal information described below, but we may not be able to serve you as efficiently or offer you some or all of our Services if you decide not to provide us with certain information.</p>
        <h4>How personal information is used</h4>
        <p>Our main goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, effective and personalized approach. In general, we use personal information to create, develop, operate, provide and improve our Services, content and advertising, as well as to prevent losses and combat fraud. We will not use your personal information for purposes other than those we disclosed to you without your permission. From time to time, we may request your permission so that we may share your personal information with third parties. You may refuse to provide your personal information to third parties if we rely on consent as a legal basis for the processing of your personal information. You may also not allow us to use your personal information for any purposes incompatible with the purposes for which we initially collected it or subsequently received your permission. If you decide to restrict the use of your personal information, some functions or services of BS may not be available to you.</p>
        <h4>Information from third party sources</h4>
        <p>From time to time, we may receive information about you from third-party sources in accordance with applicable laws, such as public databases, credit bureaus, identity verification partners, resellers and channel partners, joint marketing partners and social media platforms. As soon as we receive such information from third parties, we do not transfer it to third parties, with the exception of cases described in this Privacy Policy. This information is transmitted to the BS processors and the corporate group as necessary to provide the Services.</p>
        <h4>Collection and use of information collected automatically</h4>
        <p>We receive and store certain types of information automatically, for example, when you interact with the Sites or use the Services. This information does not necessarily reveal your identity directly, but may include information about the specific device that you are using, for example, the hardware model, operating system version, web browser software / (IP) address / MAC address / device identifier. For example, we automatically receive and record information in the logs of our server from your browser, including information about how you came and used the Services; your IP address; device type and unique device identification numbers, device event information (for example, failure, system activity and equipment settings, browser type, browser language, request date and time and referral URL), geographical location (for example, country or city) location) and other technical data collected through cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies that uniquely identify your browser.

        </p>
        <h4>How to protect and store personal information</h4>
        <p>We understand how important your privacy is, therefore, BS maintains (and requires its service providers) the appropriate physical, technical and administrative security measures to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal information that you trust us. For example, we use computer security tools such as firewalls and data encryption, we apply physical access control to our buildings and files and allow access to personal information only to those employees who require it to perform their job duties. Full credit card information is securely transmitted and hosted by a third-party payment service provider in accordance with industry-standard Payment Card Data Security (PCI DSS). This information is not available for BS .
            However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized receipt or alteration of your data will not occur. Please acknowledge that you play a vital role in protecting your personal information. When registering with our Services, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity so as not to disclose this password to third parties, and immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access or use of your account.
            In addition, we cannot guarantee or guarantee the security or confidentiality of information that you transmit to us or receive from us via the Internet or wirelessly, including email, phone or SMS, since we have no way to protect this information as soon as she will leave before her receipt

        <h4>How we share personal information with other parties</h4>
        <p>We will take care to allow access to your personal information only to those who really need it to fulfill their tasks and responsibilities, and provide it to third parties with a legitimate purpose to access it. BS will never sell or rent your personal information.</p>
